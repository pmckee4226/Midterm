            <h2>About Me:</h2>
        </header>
        <p> Hello!
            <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;My name is Pickled, I'm a Darkspear Troll Druid who specializes in shapeshifting into a cat for quick and powerful melee attacks. (That's me on the left!) I've been playing World of Warcraft for over 15 years,
            and have accomplished quite a lot! I've raided on a semi-hardcore 20-person raid group and earned the "Cutting Edge" title twice. I was the #1 Mistweaver Monk on my old server for 3 seasons of Mythic+ dungeons. I've
            been a part of quite a few Player vs Player Arena teams, hitting 2k rating at the end of the Battle for Azeroth expansion, my highest rating yet! I am an alt-oholic (someone that plays more than one character), and
            have at least one of each class at max level, which is something I've done for the last 3 expansions. I was also a Guild Master, and ran my guild for 2 years before we decided to go different ways. This game has been
            with me through almost every major life event, and is a part of who I am. I'm passionate about it and I want to help new players find their passion for it, too.
            <br>
            <br>
            &emsp;I recently grouped up with a friend's partner, who was brand new to World of Warcraft (I'll call it WoW from here), and we started playing the content that we normally do. Like I said, for an experienced player,
        this content comes easy. But what about my friend's partner? If they didn't have someone to ask, how would they know what to do? How would they know what features the game offers during the leveling experience compared to
            end-game content? How is a new player set up for success at the start of the game? That's where I want to help! My goal for this website is to become a comprehensive, straight-forward, non-intimidating resource for new players.
            <br>

        <h2>What is World of Warcraft?</h2>
    </header>
        <p> World of Warcraft (WoW) is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) released in 2004 by Blizzard Entertainment. Set in the Warcraft fantasy universe, World of Warcraft takes place within the world of Azeroth, approximately four years after the events of the previous game in the series, Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne.[3] The game was announced in 2001, and was released for the 10th anniversary of the Warcraft franchise on November 23, 2004. Since launch, World of Warcraft has had eight major expansion packs: The Burning Crusade (2007), Wrath of the Lich King (2008), Cataclysm (2010), Mists of Pandaria (2012), Warlords of Draenor (2014), Legion (2016), Battle for Azeroth (2018), and Shadowlands (2020), with a ninth, <a href="https://dragonflight.blizzard.com/en-us/" class="external" target="_blank">Dragonflight</a>, currently in development.

Similar to other MMORPGs, the game allows players to create a character avatar and explore an open game world in third- or first-person view, exploring the landscape, fighting various monsters, completing quests, and interacting with non-player characters (NPCs) or other players. The game encourages players to work together to complete quests, enter dungeons and engage in player versus player (PvP) combat, however the game can also be played solo without interacting with others. The game primarily focuses on character progression, in which players earn experience points to level up their character to make them more powerful and buy and sell items using in-game currency to acquire better equipment, among other game systems. </p>
